### run_thread_ = std::thread([this]() { Run(); }); 
The code you provided is a C++ lambda expression used to create and start a new thread. Let's break down the statement:

```cpp
run_thread_ = std::thread([this]() { Run(); });
```

1. `run_thread_`: This appears to be a variable representing an instance of `std::thread`. It is used to store the newly created thread.

2. `std::thread`: `std::thread` is a C++ standard library class that represents a thread of execution. It allows you to create and manage threads in a C++ program.

3. `[this]`: This is a capture list used in the lambda expression. It captures the `this` pointer of the current object, allowing the lambda to access member variables and functions of the object.

4. `()`: This is the parameter list of the lambda function. In this case, the lambda function takes no parameters.

5. `{ Run(); }`: This is the body of the lambda function. It calls the `Run()` member function of the current object. The `Run()` function will be executed in the new thread created by `std::thread`.

The lambda expression, `[]( ){ }`, defines an anonymous function that captures the `this` pointer and executes the `Run()` member function within it. When the lambda function is called, it will run the `Run()` function in a separate thread.

Here's an example of how this code might be used in a class:

```cpp
#include <thread>

class MyClass {
public:
    void StartThread() {
        // Create a new thread and assign it to the run_thread_ variable
        run_thread_ = std::thread([this]() { Run(); });
    }

    void Run() {
        // Code to be executed in the new thread
        // ...
    }

private:
    std::thread run_thread_;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    obj.StartThread();

    // Do other tasks in the main thread

    // Wait for the thread to finish before exiting the program
    obj.run_thread_.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, when you call `StartThread()` on an instance of `MyClass`, it will create a new thread that runs the `Run()` member function of the object. The `join()` function is used in `main()` to wait for the thread to finish its execution before the program exits.

### const and constexpr 
`const` and `constexpr` are both keywords in C++ that are used to define constants, but they have different meanings and usage.

1. `const`:
   - `const` is used to declare variables or pointers as constant. It indicates that the value of the variable cannot be changed after initialization.
   - When used with a variable, it means the variable is read-only, and any attempt to modify its value will result in a compilation error.
   - When used with a pointer, it means the pointer itself is constant, and it cannot be changed to point to a different memory location. However, the value being pointed to can still be modified.
   - `const` variables must be initialized when declared, and they cannot be modified later in the program.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     const int myConstVar = 10;   // A constant variable
     const int* ptrToConst = &myConstVar;  // A pointer to a constant variable
     ```

2. `constexpr`:
   - `constexpr` is used to declare variables or functions as constants that are evaluated at compile-time.
   - When used with a variable, it means the value of the variable can be computed at compile-time, and it cannot change at runtime.
   - When used with a function, it means the function must be able to be evaluated at compile-time for the result to be used as a constant expression.
   - `constexpr` variables and functions can be used in contexts where constant expressions are required, such as array sizes, template arguments, and more.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     constexpr int myConstExpr = 5 + 3;  // A constant expression
     constexpr int square(int x) { return x * x; }  // A constexpr function
     ```

In summary, `const` is used to define runtime constants that cannot be modified after initialization, while `constexpr` is used to define compile-time constants that are evaluated at compile-time and can be used in contexts where constant expressions are required.

###  memset(&m_imgs, 0, sizeof(m_imgs));   
The code you provided is using the `memset` function to set a block of memory to a specific value, often used to initialize arrays or structs with zeros. Let's break down the code:

```cpp
memset(&m_imgs, 0, sizeof(m_imgs));
```

1. `memset`: This is a C standard library function that stands for "memory set." It is commonly used to set a block of memory to a specific value.

2. `&m_imgs`: This is the address of the memory block you want to set. `m_imgs` is likely a variable or struct that represents an array or a collection of elements.

3. `0`: This is the value that you want to set the memory to. In this case, `0` represents the value of null or zero.

4. `sizeof(m_imgs)`: This is the size of the memory block in bytes that you want to set. It calculates the size of the `m_imgs` variable or struct.

So, the `memset` function is being used here to set the memory represented by the variable `m_imgs` to all zeros, effectively initializing it. This is often used to ensure that arrays or structs are initialized to a known state before being used.

However, it's important to note that using `memset` to set memory containing non-trivial types (like C++ classes with constructors, destructors, etc.) may not result in expected behavior. In C++, it's generally recommended to use constructors to initialize objects properly. If `m_imgs` is an array of objects or a struct containing objects, you might consider using appropriate constructors or initialization methods provided by those objects instead.

### user define type prefix and suffix ++ operation 
To define your own user-defined type with custom prefix and suffix increment operations, you need to overload the `++` operator for your class. In C++, this can be achieved by creating member functions for both the prefix and suffix versions of the `++` operator.

Here's how you can define a custom user-defined type with prefix and suffix increment operations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyNumber {
private:
    int value;

public:
    MyNumber(int val) : value(val) {}

    // Prefix increment (++num)
    MyNumber& operator++() {
        value++;
        return *this;
    }

    // Suffix increment (num++)
    MyNumber operator++(int) {
        MyNumber temp = *this;
        value++;
        return temp;
    }

    int getValue() const {
        return value;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyNumber num(5);

    // Prefix increment
    ++num;
    std::cout << "After prefix increment: " << num.getValue() << std::endl;

    // Suffix increment
    MyNumber num2 = num++;
    std::cout << "After suffix increment: " << num.getValue() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value of num2: " << num2.getValue() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `MyNumber` class defines both the prefix and suffix increment operators as member functions. The prefix increment (`++num`) modifies the value and returns a reference to the modified object. The suffix increment (`num++`) returns a copy of the original object and then increments the value.

Remember that when overloading operators, it's important to maintain the expected behavior and adhere to the conventions of the language. The prefix increment operator should return a reference to the modified object, while the suffix increment operator should return a copy of the original object before modification.

### virtual override 
In C++, `virtual` and `override` are keywords used in the context of class inheritance and polymorphism to control the behavior of functions in derived classes. Let's take a closer look at what each keyword does:

1. **`virtual` Keyword**:
   - When you declare a member function as `virtual` in a base class, you're indicating that this function can be overridden by derived classes.
   - This is a key feature of polymorphism in C++. It allows you to call the appropriate version of a function based on the actual type of the object, rather than the type of the pointer or reference.
   - The `virtual` keyword is used in the base class declaration of the function.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   class Base {
   public:
       virtual void doSomething() {
           // Base class implementation
       }
   };
   ```

2. **`override` Keyword**:
   - The `override` keyword is used in a derived class to indicate that a member function is intended to override a `virtual` function from the base class.
   - It helps catch errors during compilation. If you use `override` but there's no matching `virtual` function in the base class, the compiler will generate an error.
   - This keyword enhances code clarity and helps prevent accidental mistakes in function overrides.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   class Derived : public Base {
   public:
       void doSomething() override {
           // Derived class implementation
       }
   };
   ```

In summary, the combination of `virtual` and `override` keywords in C++ is crucial for achieving polymorphism and ensuring that the correct overridden function is called based on the object's actual type. The `virtual` keyword in the base class indicates that a function can be overridden, and the `override` keyword in the derived class explicitly states the intention to override the base class function, helping prevent errors.

### __android_log_print 
`__android_log_print` is a logging function provided by the Android NDK (Native Development Kit) for writing log messages from native code (C or C++) to the Android logcat. The logcat is a system-wide logging mechanism in Android that allows developers to monitor and debug their applications.

The function signature of `__android_log_print` is as follows:

```cpp
int __android_log_print(int prio, const char* tag, const char* fmt, ...);
```

Parameters:
- `prio`: Priority level of the log message. It can be one of the following constants: `ANDROID_LOG_VERBOSE`, `ANDROID_LOG_DEBUG`, `ANDROID_LOG_INFO`, `ANDROID_LOG_WARN`, `ANDROID_LOG_ERROR`, or `ANDROID_LOG_FATAL`.
- `tag`: A tag to identify the log messages. This helps in categorizing and filtering log messages.
- `fmt`: The format string for the log message.
- `...`: Variadic arguments that correspond to the format specifiers in the format string.

Usage example:

```cpp
#include <android/log.h>

void logMessage() {
    const char* tag = "MyApp";
    const char* message = "Hello, Android!";
    
    __android_log_print(ANDROID_LOG_INFO, tag, "Message: %s", message);
}
```

In this example, the `logMessage` function uses `__android_log_print` to print an informational log message with the tag "MyApp" and the message "Message: Hello, Android!".

The log messages generated using `__android_log_print` can be viewed in the Android logcat using commands like `adb logcat` or through IDEs like Android Studio. This helps in debugging and monitoring native code running on an Android device or emulator.

### time() localtime() 
`time()` and `localtime()` are C and C++ functions commonly used for working with date and time in programming.

1. **`time()` Function**:
   - The `time()` function is used to get the current system time in seconds since the "Epoch" (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). It returns the time as a `time_t` data type.
   - This function is part of the `<ctime>` or `<time.h>` header in C and C++.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <ctime>

   int main() {
       time_t currentTime;
       time(&currentTime);
       std::cout << "Current time: " << currentTime << std::endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **`localtime()` Function**:
   - The `localtime()` function is used to convert a `time_t` value into a `struct tm` structure representing the local time. This structure contains separate fields for year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, and more.
   - This function is part of the `<ctime>` or `<time.h>` header in C and C++.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <ctime>

   int main() {
       time_t currentTime;
       time(&currentTime);

       struct tm* localTime = localtime(&currentTime);

       std::cout << "Local time: "
                 << localTime->tm_hour << ":" << localTime->tm_min << ":" << localTime->tm_sec
                 << " " << localTime->tm_mday << "/" << localTime->tm_mon + 1 << "/" << localTime->tm_year + 1900
                 << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

In the `localtime()` example, the `struct tm` structure is used to extract and display various components of the local time, such as hours, minutes, seconds, day, month, and year.

Both `time()` and `localtime()` are fundamental for working with time-related calculations, date formatting, and more in C and C++ programming.
